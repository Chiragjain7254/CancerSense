# CancerSense

## Overview
CancerSense is a breast cancer detection system implemented using a neural network model. This project preprocesses breast cancer data, trains the neural network model, and allows users to make predictions based on tumor features.

## Files
- `cancersense.py`: Python script containing the code for the breast cancer detection system.
- `CancerSense.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file containing the same code as `cancersense.py`, created using Google Colab.
- `cancersense output pdf.pdf`: Output PDF file generated from the Colab Notebook.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and its files.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Programming language used for coding the detection system.
- TensorFlow: Open-source library used for building and training the neural network model.
- scikit-learn: Library used for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- Jupyter Notebook: Used for interactive development and documentation.
- Google Colab: Online platform used for development. 

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the files.
3. Run `cancersense.py` using a Python environment.
4. Follow the instructions to interact with the breast cancer detection system.

## Usage
- Input tumor features as required by the system.
- Receive predictions on whether the tumor is malignant or benign.
